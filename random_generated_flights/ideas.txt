1.	Determine the criteria for a "cheap" flight. This will depend on your specific use case, but some common criteria
 	might include a low price, a high discount, or a combination of both.

2.	Create a list of fake flight data that meets your criteria for a cheap flight. You can do this manually by
	constructing a list of dictionaries, each representing a fake flight with the relevant information (e.g., origin,
	destination, price, etc.). Alternatively, you could use a tool like Faker to generate fake flight data for you.

3.	Write a function that takes a list of flights and a threshold price as input, and returns a list of flights that
	meet the criteria for being cheap. This function should use the criteria you determined in step 1 to determine
	which flights are cheap.

4.	Write a test function that calls your flight price monitor system with the list of fake flights as input, and
	verifies that the system correctly identifies the cheap flights and triggers the appropriate response. You can
	do this by comparing the output of your system to the expected output (i.e., the list of cheap flights that you
	created in step 2).

5.	Run your test function to ensure that your flight price monitor system is working correctly with fake data.
