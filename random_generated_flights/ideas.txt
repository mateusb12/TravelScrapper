1.	Determine the format and structure of the flight data you will be using for your test. This may include information
	such as the flight origin, destination, price, and departure and arrival dates.

2.	Create a sample set of fake flight data that you will use for testing. This data should include a range of prices,
	so that you can test how your system responds to both cheaper and more expensive flights.

3.	Set up your test environment by creating a test database or file where you can store the fake flight data.

4.	Write a script or function that reads the fake flight data and uses it to trigger your flight price monitor system.
	This could involve making API calls to your system or interacting with it in some other way.

5.	Test your system using the fake flight data to ensure that it is functioning as expected. You may want to try a
	variety of different test cases, such as triggering the system with a flight that is significantly cheaper than the current lowest price, or with a flight that is only slightly cheaper.

6.	Debug and refine your system as needed based on the results of your testing.

7.	Once you are confident that your system is working correctly, you can begin using it with real flight
	data to monitor for new cheap flights.
