	1. Identify the flight data that you want to track. This might include the origin and destination airports,
the dates of travel, and any other relevant details such as the number of passengers or the desired class of service.

	2. Set up an API endpoint that provides access to the flight price data that you want to track.
This might involve signing up for an API key with a flight data provider, or using a pre-existing API endpoint that
is available for free or for a fee.

	3. Write code to periodically query the API endpoint for flight price data.
This could be done on a regular schedule (e.g. every hour) using a task scheduler or cron job.
Alternatively, you could use a webhook or other real-time notification system to receive updates as soon as
new flight price data becomes available.

	4. Store the flight price data in a database or other persistent storage system. This will allow you to track changes
in flight prices over time, and to generate alerts when prices reach a certain threshold.

	5. Implement the alerting system itself. This could involve sending email or SMS notifications to users when flight
prices meet certain criteria (e.g. when prices drop below a certain level), or displaying alerts on a web page or mobile app.

	6. Test and debug the system to ensure that it is functioning correctly and that alerts are being generated as expected.
This might involve setting up test data and simulated API responses, or using a staging environment to test the system
in a production-like environment.

	7. Deploy the system to a production environment, and monitor it to ensure that it is functioning correctly
and meeting the needs of users. This might involve monitoring logs and metrics, and making updates or changes as needed
to improve the system's performance and reliability.
