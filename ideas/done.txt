	1. Identify the flight data that you want to track. This might include the origin and destination airports,
the dates of travel, and any other relevant details such as the number of passengers or the desired class of service.

    	2. Set up an API endpoint that provides access to the flight price data that you want to track.
This might involve signing up for an API key with a flight data provider, or using a pre-existing API endpoint that
is available for free or for a fee.

    	3. Store the flight price data in a database or other persistent storage system. This will allow you totrack
changes in flight prices over time, and to generate alerts when prices reach a certain threshold.


	4. Implement the alerting system itself. This could involve sending email or SMS notifications to users when
flight prices meet certain criteria (e.g. when prices drop below a certain level), or displaying alerts on a web page
or mobile app.

	5. Test and debug the system to ensure that it is functioning correctly and that alerts are being generated as
expected. This might involve setting up test data and simulated API responses, or using a staging environment to test
the system in a production-like environment.
