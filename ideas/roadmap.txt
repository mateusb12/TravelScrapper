→ populate dataset with fillers
→ filler_generator has 70% chance of generating a flight with average price, 20% chance of generating an
overpriced flight and 10% chance of generating a cheap flight
→ create a function called "update_flight()" that can insert new flights in our dataset
→ create nice visualizations for the dataset (barplot, normal_dist, bee swarm plot, etc)
→ create a send_email() function
→ attach that function inside update_flight()
→ from airport to airport (ABC-DEF)
→ from country to country (Poland-France)
→ include how distant the airport is from the city center
→ include flixbus and regiojet
→ include accomodation like booking
