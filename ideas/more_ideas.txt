There are several potential features that you could consider implementing for your flight monitor, depending on your
goals and the needs of your users. Some potential options could include:

1.	Alerts for price changes: You could set up a system to track the prices of flights over time and send alerts
to users when the prices change significantly.

2.	Alerts for flight delays or cancellations: You could use data from the API or other sources to track the
status of flights and send alerts to users if their flights are delayed or cancelled.

3.	Customized alerts: You could allow users to specify their preferred destinations, departure dates, and
other preferences, and send them customized alerts based on those criteria.

4.	Integration with other travel services: You could integrate your flight monitor with other travel services,
such as hotel booking or car rental, to allow users to easily book all their travel arrangements in one place.

5.	Data visualization: You could provide users with visualizations of flight prices over time, or allow them to
compare prices for different destinations or dates.

6.	Recommendation system: You could use machine learning techniques to make recommendations to users based on
their past searches or other factors, such as their preferred destinations or travel dates.
